This is the country flags quiz project. There are 10 questions and every question have 5 answers. You can answer them and at the end you can see your result. The app fetch random question and random answers from API. I used my Express.js-RandomCountriesApi for that which you can find https://github.com/IlgarNasirov/Express.js-RandomCountriesApi from this URL. The app uses http for sending http request via Flutter.
